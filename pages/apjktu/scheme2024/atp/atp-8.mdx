# Prime Numbers Less Than N

## Aim

Write a program to print all prime numbers less than a given number N.

## Algorithm

1. Start
2. Define a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.
3. Iterate through all numbers less than N.
4. Use the `is_prime` function to check if the number is prime.
5. Print the prime numbers.
6. End

## Program

```python filename="prime_numbers.py" copy showLineNumbers
# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to print all prime numbers less than N
def print_primes_less_than_n(n):
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            print(num, end=' ')

# Take input from the user
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"Prime numbers less than {n} are:")
print_primes_less_than_n(n)
```

## Sample Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a number: 20
Prime numbers less than 20 are:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
```

## Explanation

* The program defines a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime:
  - The function takes a number `num` as input.
  - If `num` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `False` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
  - For each number `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `num`:
    - If `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), it returns `False` because `num` has a divisor other than 1 and itself.
  - If no divisors are found, it returns `True` because `num` is a prime number.

* The program defines a function `print_primes_less_than_n` to print all prime numbers less than N:
  - The function takes a number `n` as input.
  - For each number `num` from 2 to `n-1`:
    - It uses the `is_prime` function to check if `num` is prime.
    - If `num` is prime, it prints `num` followed by a space.

* The program takes an input number `N` from the user:
  - It asks the user to enter a number and stores it in the variable `n`.

* The program prints all prime numbers less than `N` using the `print_primes_less_than_n` function:
  - It calls the `print_primes_less_than_n` function with `n` as the argument.
  - The function prints all prime numbers less than `n`.

* Example:
  - If the user enters `20`, the program will print `2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19` because these are the prime numbers less than 20.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the `is_prime` function is O(√n) as it checks divisibility up to the square root of the number. The overall time complexity of the program is O(n√n) as it checks all numbers less than N.

The space complexity of the program is O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of space irrespective of the input size.

## How can you improve this program?

1. You can optimize the `is_prime` function by skipping even numbers after checking for 2.
2. You can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find all prime numbers less than N more efficiently.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to write a Python program to print all prime numbers less than a given number N. You learned how to define a function to check if a number is prime and how to use this function to print prime numbers.
