# Factorial of a Number Using Recursion

## Aim

Write a program to find the factorial of a number using recursion in Python.

> * A factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It is denoted by `n!`.
> * Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

## Algorithm

1. **Start**
2. **Define a recursive function `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a number:**
   - If the number is 0 or 1, return 1 (base case).
   - Otherwise, return the number multiplied by the factorial of the number minus 1 (recursive case).
3. **Take input from the user:**
   - Ask the user to enter a non-negative integer `n`.
4. **Calculate the factorial of the number:**
   - Call the `factorial` function with `n` as the argument and store the result.
5. **Print the result:**
   - Display the factorial of the number.
6. **End**

## Program

```python filename="factorial_recursion.py" copy showLineNumbers
# Define a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Take input from the user
n = int(input("Enter a non-negative integer: "))

# Calculate the factorial of the number
result = factorial(n)

# Print the result
print(f"The factorial of {n} is {result}")
```

## Sample Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter a non-negative integer: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120
```

## Explanation

* We define a recursive function `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a number:
  - If the number `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 and 1 is 1.
  - Otherwise, the function returns `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n-1`, which is the recursive call.

* Let's break down the execution of the recursive function with an example:
  - Suppose the user enters `5`.
  - The function call `factorial(5)` will execute as follows:
    1. `factorial(5)`:
       - Since `5` is not 0 or 1, it returns `5 * factorial(4)`.
    2. `factorial(4)`:
       - Since `4` is not 0 or 1, it returns `4 * factorial(3)`.
    3. `factorial(3)`:
       - Since `3` is not 0 or 1, it returns `3 * factorial(2)`.
    4. `factorial(2)`:
       - Since `2` is not 0 or 1, it returns `2 * factorial(1)`.
    5. `factorial(1)`:
       - Since `1` is 1, it returns `1`.

* Now, let's substitute back the values:
  - `factorial(1)` returns `1`.
  - `factorial(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`.
  - `factorial(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`.
  - `factorial(4)` returns `4 * 6 = 24`.
  - `factorial(5)` returns `5 * 24 = 120`.

* Therefore, the factorial of `5` is `120`.

* We take an input number `n` from the user and store it in the variable `n`.
* We calculate the factorial of `n` by calling the `factorial` function with `n` as the argument and store the result in the variable `result`.
* We print the result using the statement `print(f"The factorial of {n} is {result}")`.

## Complexity Analysis

* The time complexity of the recursive factorial function is `O(n)` because it makes `n` recursive calls.
* The space complexity of the recursive factorial function is `O(n)` because it uses the call stack to store `n` recursive calls.

## How can you improve this program?

* You can add error handling to ensure the user enters a non-negative integer.
* You can implement an iterative version of the factorial function to avoid the overhead of recursive calls.
* You can use memoization to optimize the recursive function by storing previously calculated results.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to find the factorial of a number using recursion in Python. We discussed the algorithm, program, and sample input/output for calculating the factorial. We also analyzed the complexity of the recursive factorial function and suggested possible improvements.
