# Recursive Function to Add Two Positive Numbers

## Aim

Write a program to add two positive numbers using recursion in Python.

> * Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
> * Adding two numbers using recursion involves breaking down the addition process into smaller steps until a base case is reached.

## Algorithm

1. **Start**
2. **Define a recursive function `add` to add two positive numbers:**
   - If the second number is 0, return the first number (base case).
   - Otherwise, return 1 plus the result of adding the first number and the second number minus 1 (recursive case).
3. **Take input from the user:**
   - Ask the user to enter two positive integers `a` and `b`.
4. **Calculate the sum of the two numbers:**
   - Call the `add` function with `a` and `b` as arguments and store the result.
5. **Print the result:**
   - Display the sum of the two numbers.
6. **End**

## Program

```python filename="add_recursion.py" copy showLineNumbers
# Define a recursive function to add two positive numbers
def add(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return 1 + add(a, b - 1)

# Take input from the user
a = int(input("Enter the first positive integer: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second positive integer: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
result = add(a, b)

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {result}")
```

## Sample Input/Output

```plaintext
Enter the first positive integer: 5
Enter the second positive integer: 3
The sum of 5 and 3 is 8
```

## Explanation

* We define a recursive function `add` to add two positive numbers:
  - If the second number `b` is 0, the function returns the first number `a` because adding 0 to any number results in the number itself.
  - Otherwise, the function returns `1` plus the result of adding `a` and `b-1`, which is the recursive call.

* Let's break down the execution of the recursive function with an example:
  - Suppose the user enters `5` and `3`.
  - The function call `add(5, 3)` will execute as follows:
    1. `add(5, 3)`:
       - Since `3` is not 0, it returns `1 + add(5, 2)`.
    2. `add(5, 2)`:
       - Since `2` is not 0, it returns `1 + add(5, 1)`.
    3. `add(5, 1)`:
       - Since `1` is not 0, it returns `1 + add(5, 0)`.
    4. `add(5, 0)`:
       - Since `0` is 0, it returns `5`.

* Now, let's substitute back the values:
  - `add(5, 0)` returns `5`.
  - `add(5, 1)` returns `1 + 5 = 6`.
  - `add(5, 2)` returns `1 + 6 = 7`.
  - `add(5, 3)` returns `1 + 7 = 8`.

* Therefore, the sum of `5` and `3` is `8`.

* We take two input numbers `a` and `b` from the user and store them in the variables `a` and `b`.
* We calculate the sum of `a` and `b` by calling the `add` function with `a` and `b` as arguments and store the result in the variable `result`.
* We print the result using the statement `print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {result}")`.

## Complexity Analysis

* The time complexity of the recursive addition function is `O(b)` because it makes `b` recursive calls.
* The space complexity of the recursive addition function is `O(b)` because it uses the call stack to store `b` recursive calls.

## How can you improve this program?

* You can add error handling to ensure the user enters positive integers.
* You can implement an iterative version of the addition function to avoid the overhead of recursive calls.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we learned how to add two positive numbers using recursion in Python. We discussed the algorithm, program, and sample input/output for adding two numbers. We also analyzed the complexity of the recursive addition function and suggested possible improvements.
